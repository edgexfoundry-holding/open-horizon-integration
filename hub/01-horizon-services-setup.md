If you clone this repository, it will be easier to modify and use the configuration and resource files. 
The following instructions will assume that you have done so and that the contents are in `./horizon-edgex`

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/edgexfoundry-holding/open-horizon-integration.git
```

### Install Prerequisites

NOTE: If you are not already running as root, please become root with `sudo -s` or similar.

``` bash
apt-get -y update
apt-get -y install apache2-utils jq curl make gcc
```

### Install Container Engine

``` bash
curl -fsSL get.docker.com | sh
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.5/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
